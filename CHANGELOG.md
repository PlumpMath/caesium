# 0.1.2

As 0.1.1, but actually supporting those features, by bumping the
kalium dependency to 0.3.0.

# 0.1.1

This release will never be uploaded anywhere because the upstream
dependency, kalium, does not yet have a release that supports all
features caesium exposes.

- generichash (BLAKE2b) support
- secretbox (XSalsa20 + Poly1305-AES) support
